# Repository Agent Instructions

## Instruction Scope

- This file contains rules shared by the whole repository.
- Before changing a subtree, check for a nearer `AGENTS.md`; local instructions add to or override this file for that subtree.
- This repository uses only `AGENTS.md` for agent instructions and `CONTEXT.md` for domain context. Do not duplicate these rules in tool-specific instruction files.
- Keep one `AGENTS.md` and one `CONTEXT.md` per independently managed large module. Do not add finer-grained files unless that subtree has genuinely independent ownership and rules.
- Agent hosts that do not discover `AGENTS.md` automatically must be configured or prompted to read the applicable files.
- See [`docs/agents/instruction-files.md`](docs/agents/instruction-files.md) for discovery and precedence rules.

## Domain Documentation

- Before changing domain behavior or terminology, read the root [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md), then the relevant module `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs.
- `CONTEXT.md` files are glossaries only. Put implementation constraints in `AGENTS.md` and durable architectural decisions in ADRs.
- All ADRs live in the root [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/), including decisions scoped to a single module.
- See [`docs/agents/domain.md`](docs/agents/domain.md).

## Issue Tracker

- Issues and PRDs are tracked in GitHub Issues through `gh`. See [`docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`](docs/agents/issue-tracker.md).
- Use the canonical triage labels documented in [`docs/agents/triage-labels.md`](docs/agents/triage-labels.md).

## Testing

- Before writing, changing, reviewing, or running tests, read [`docs/test/testing-guide.md`](docs/test/testing-guide.md).
- Keep tests under the owning module's `src/test`; do not use `src/intg-test`.
- Run fast backend tests with `mvn -f apps/server/pom.xml test`.
- Run the complete backend suite with `mvn -f apps/server/pom.xml verify`. It requires Docker for Testcontainers MySQL 8 and Redis 8; do not substitute H2, local services, or shared services.

## Agent Development Ports

- When an AI agent starts Admin or Mobile in development, it must use the port currently configured in the owning application's `.env.development`: `VITE_PORT` for Admin and `VITE_APP_PORT` for Mobile. Start the normal development command so Vite loads that file; do not hard-code the current value or override it with a command-line port.
- When an AI agent starts the backend, it must use the current `server.port` value from `apps/server/novum-bootstrap/src/main/resources/application.yml`; do not hard-code or override that value in the launch command.
- Immediately before starting any of these services, an AI agent must read the current configured port, inspect that exact port, and automatically terminate any process listening on it. It must not choose a different port or modify application configuration merely to avoid a port conflict.

## Git And Delivery

- Leave changes uncommitted unless the user explicitly requests a commit.
- When a commit is requested, use `pnpm run commit`; never invoke `git commit` directly.
- Do not push or create or update a pull request unless the user explicitly requests remote delivery.
- Remote delivery must use a pull request. Never push directly to `main` or another target branch; default the PR base to `main` unless the user specifies otherwise.
